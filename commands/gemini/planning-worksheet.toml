# Planning Worksheet

Compile a planning worksheet of two documents:
- What and why
- How

Source the active chat context as the primary source of truth. IMPORTANT: Don't use any external file references. Include `Additional Context` if submitted.

Compile a planning worksheet of two documents:
- What and why
- How

Source the active chat context as the primary source of truth. IMPORTANT: Don't use any external file references. Include `Additional Context` if submitted.

**Important Reminder:** READ ONLY AND OUTPUT TWO MARKDOWN DOCUMENTS! Do not implement. Just compile the two documents and follow the `Output Format`.

## Instructions

Using the `Template A` and `Template B` below, the current chat context and any `Additional Context` submitted:

1. Produce TWO completed Markdown documents:
   - Document 1: What and Why (Template A)
   - Document 2: How: Implementation Plan (Template B)
2. Extract Intent, Value, and Signals of success from the conversation for Document 1. Keep them concise.
3. For Document 2, outline Constraints & principles and Unknowns & assumptions.
   - Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] for any ambiguity rather than guessing.
4. Provide a brief Approach sketch aligned to the conversation context.
5. Set an appropriate Execution cadence (e.g., “Generic phases” or “Add QA checkpoint prior to release”).
6. Fill Logistics with any IDs/owners/links mentioned in the conversation. If not present, leave placeholders.
7. If "$ARGUMENTS" is provided, incorporate them as clarifying notes or into relevant sections of either document.
8. Output only the two completed Markdown documents. Do not include commentary, the raw template, or extra prose.

## Project Context

@AGENTS.md

## Template

Use exactly these two structures when producing the final output; do not include this Template section in your response:

### Template A — What and Why

```markdown
# <Feature, Chore or Bugfix Title>

## What and Why

### Intent (one-liner)

- <One sentence capturing the essence of the work>

### Value (why)

- <User/business value #1>
- <User/business value #2>

### Signals of success

- <Measurable or acceptance statement #1>
- <Measurable or acceptance statement #2>
```

### Template B — How: Implementation Plan

```markdown
# <Feature, Chore or Bugfix Title>

## How: Implementation Plan

### Constraints & principles

- <Guardrails, org principles, and boundaries to respect>

### Unknowns & assumptions

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question or ambiguity>]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question or ambiguity>]

### Approach sketch

<Freeform: short paragraph, quick flow description, or lightweight diagram in text>

### Execution cadence

<e.g., "Generic phases" or "Add QA checkpoint prior to release">

### Logistics

- Task ID(s): <Archon ID, ticket IDs>
- Owner(s): <names/roles>
- Links: <Task link(s) | PR(s) | Design Doc(s)/ADR(s)>
- Type/Scope: <Feature | Bugfix | Codebase chore | Experiment | Documentation; key surfaces/components>

### Risks & mitigations (Optional)

- <Top risks and how you'd address them>

### Scope (in/out) (Optional)

- In: <Key items>
- Out: <Key exclusions>

### Notes & links (Optional)

- <Pointers to context, prior art, or references>
```

## Output Format

Return TWO Markdown documents, in this order:

1) What and Why document (Template A):
   - Includes: Intent, Value, Signals of success
2) How: Implementation Plan document (Template B):
   - Includes: Constraints & principles, Unknowns & assumptions, Approach sketch, Execution cadence, Logistics
   - Optional: Risks & mitigations, Scope (in/out), Notes & links

Do not include commentary, the raw templates, or extra prose. Separate the two documents with a blank line and a line containing only `---`, or return them as two distinct Markdown blocks if supported.

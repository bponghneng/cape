  # /prime - Build Foundational Knowledge

  Use the **general-purpose** agent to quickly gather project context and return a concise summary.

  ## Task Instructions for Subagent

  You are tasked with gathering foundational project knowledge efficiently.

  ### Files to Read (if they exist):
  - README.md
  - CLAUDE.md
  - package.json (or requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Gemfile, etc.)
  - .gitignore

  ### Commands to Run:
  - `ls -1` (root directory listing)
  - `git ls-files | head -50` (sample of tracked files)

  ### Your Output

  Provide a **concise structured summary** (under 500 words) covering:

  #### 1. Project Overview (2-3 sentences)
  - What it does and problem it solves
  - Key features or capabilities

  #### 2. Technology Stack (3-5 bullet points)
  - Primary language(s) and framework(s)
  - Major dependencies (list 3-5 most important)
  - Build/run tooling

  #### 3. Code Organization (3-5 bullet points)
  - Main directories and their purposes
  - Entry points (if obvious from structure)
  - Key configuration files present

  #### 4. Development Context (2-4 bullet points)
  - Coding conventions or standards (from CLAUDE.md)
  - Common workflows or commands
  - Any critical setup notes

  ### Constraints:
  - Minimize reading source code files
  - Minimize searching for patterns across the codebase
  - Minimize analysis of code relationships or architecture
  - Use directory structure and config files to infer organization
  - Keep the summary concise and actionable
  - Focus on information needed to start working effectively

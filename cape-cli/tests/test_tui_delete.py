# TODO: Add integration tests using run_test() and Pilot
# 
# Integration tests would exercise the complete delete flow end-to-end:
#  - Test deleting pending issues from list screen
#  - Test that started issues show warning when delete is attempted
#  - Test deleting from detail screen
#  - Test cancelling delete confirmation
# 
# Challenge: These tests require mocking Textual's @work decorator behavior
# and coordinating async operations with background threads. The current unit
# tests provide good coverage of the delete logic. Full integration tests can
# be added when there's a specific need or when we have better patterns for
# mocking the worker threads.
# 
# See AGENTS.md (Testing Strategy section) for examples of how to structure
# these tests using app.run_test() and pilot.

# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Workspace Structure**

This is a **workspace folder**. The project repository is `[repo directory]`. Read and follow `README.md` for complete details on relevant and irrelevant files.

## Project Overview

[description of project]

## Workflow Style & Collaboration Rules

### Code Changes & Investigation Workflow

- **Research First**: Investigate thoroughly before proposing solutions. Use search
  tools and documentation to gather facts rather than making assumptions.
- **Discuss Before Implementing**: Present findings and proposed approaches for
  approval before making code changes. Explain options and trade-offs.
- **Respect Original Code**: Try to understand where code came from and what problem
  it's solving before assuming it can be changed.
- **Question Assumptions**: If something doesn't work as expected, investigate the
  root cause. Look for version differences, environment issues, or missing context.

### Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Read errors carefully and identify the real issue
2. **Research**: Use tools and documentation to understand the problem context
3. **Propose**: Present findings and suggest solution options with pros/cons
4. **Implement**: Only after approval, make minimal necessary changes
5. **Clean Up**: Remove temporary test files or debugging code

### Communication

- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- If blocked or uncertain, ask for guidance rather than guessing

## Simplicity-First Mindset

Your guidance is directed by these core principles:

1. **Start with MVP**: Focus on core functionality that delivers immediate value
2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Don't add features "just in case"
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add what's absolutely necessary for requirements
4. **Clear Over Clever**: Simple, maintainable solutions over complex architectures

Apply these principles when evaluating whether complex patterns, or advanced optimizations are truly needed or if simpler solutions would suffice.

## Development Commands

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Project Repository**: As noted in `Workspace Structure`, the project repository is `[repo directory]`. All of the development commands are run from the root of the project repository.

- `[command2 for another development task]` - [Description of command2]

**Code Quality Tools**:

- `[code-quality-tool1]`: [command to run1]
- `[code-quality-tool2]`: [command to run2]

**Testing**:
- `[test-tool1]`: [Description of test tool1]
- `[test-tool2]`: [Description of test tool2]

**[Other Tools, like Code Generators, Development Dependencies, etc.]**:
- `[other-tool1]`: [Description of other tool1]
- `[other-tool2]`: [Description of other tool2]
